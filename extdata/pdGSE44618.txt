They were deposited into cell lysis solution (Clontech SMARTer Ultra Low RNA kit) and frozen at -80C. Amplified cDNA was then prepared following the manufacturer's protocol. The amplified cDNA was fragmented and tagged using the Nextera Illumina Genomic DNA prep kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The fragmented cDNA libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument.	9606	****************************	GSM1299398 record metadata submitted on Dec 30 2013 may be obsolete, up to date experimental metadata was resubmitted by ENCODE DCC and is available at GSE78432	****************************	Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq or GAIIx.
